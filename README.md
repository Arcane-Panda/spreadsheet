A simple spreadsheet that consists of an infinite number of named cells. 
    /// A string is a cell name if and only if it consists of one or more letters,
    /// followed by one or more digits AND it satisfies the predicate IsValid.
    /// For example, "A15", "a15", "XY032", and "BC7" are cell names so long as they
    /// satisfy IsValid.  On the other hand, "Z", "X_", and "hello" are not cell names,
    /// regardless of IsValid.
    /// 
    /// Any valid incoming cell name, whether passed as a parameter or embedded in a formula,
    /// must be normalized with the Normalize method before it is used by or saved in 
    /// this spreadsheet.  For example, if Normalize is s => s.ToUpper(), then
    /// the Formula "x3+a5" should be converted to "X3+A5" before use.
    /// 
    /// A spreadsheet contains a cell corresponding to every possible cell name.  
    /// In addition to a name, each cell has a contents and a value.  The distinction is
    /// important.
    /// 
    /// The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
    /// contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.  (By analogy, the contents
    /// of a cell in Excel is what is displayed on the editing line when the cell is selected.)
    /// 
    /// In a new spreadsheet, the contents of every cell is the empty string.
    ///  
    /// The value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.  
    /// (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
    /// in the grid.)
